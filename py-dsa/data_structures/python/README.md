# Data Structures used in Algorithms (Python)
There are five various data structures that can be used to store collections:
- **Lists**: Ordered mutable sequences of elements
- **Tuples**: Ordered immutable sequences of elements
- **Sets**: Unordered bags of elements
- **Dictionary**: Unordered bags of key-value pairs
- **Data frames**: Two-dimensional structures to store two-dimensional data

## List
- A list is the main data structure used to store a mutable sequence of elements.
- The sequence of data elements stored in the list need not be of the same type.
