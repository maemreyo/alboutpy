# Designing Algorithms

## Introduction the basic concepts of design an algorithm
### Concern 1 - Will the designed algorithm produce the result we expect?
### Concern 2 - Is this the optimal way to get these results?
### Concern 3 - How is the algorithm going to perform on larger datasets?



## Understand algorithm strategies
### Understanding the divide-and-conquer strategy
### Understanding the dynamic programming strategy
### Understanding greedy algorithms



## Practical application - Solving the TSP
### Using a brute-force strategy
### Using a greedy algorithm


## Presenting the PageRank algorithm
### Problem definition
### Implement the PageRank algorithm



## Understanding linear programming
### Formulating a linear programming problem
