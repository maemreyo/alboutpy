# Traditional Supervised Learning Algorithms

## Understanding supervised machine learning

- Machine learning focuses on using data-driven approaches to create autonomous systems that can help us to make
  decisions with or without human supervision. In order to create these autonomous systems, machine learning uses a
  group of algorithms and methodologies to discover and formulate repeatable patterns in data.
- One of the most popular and powerful methodologies used in ML is the supervised machine learning approach. In
  supervised machine learning, an algorithm is given a set of inputs called **features**, and their corresponding
  outputs, called **target variables**.
- Using a given dataset, a supervised machine learning algorithm is used to train a model that captures the complex
  relationship between the features and target variables represented by a mathematical formula. This trained model is
  the basic vehicle that is used for prediction.
- Predictions are made by generating the target variable of an unfamiliar set of features through the trained model. The
  ability to learn from existing data in supervised learning is similar to the ability of the human brain to learn from
  experience. This learning ability in supervised learning uses one of the attributes of the human brain and is a
  fundamental way of opening the gates to bring decision-making power and intelligence to machines.
